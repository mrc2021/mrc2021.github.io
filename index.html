                    <p class="lead">
                        The motivation of the workshop is to promote the research and application of Explainable Recommendation and Search, under the background of Explainable AI in a more general sense. Explainable recommendation and search attempt to develop models or methods that not only generate high-quality recommendation or search results, but also intuitive explanations of the results for users or system designers, which can help improve the system transparency, persuasiveness, trustworthiness, and effectiveness, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        In a broader sense, researchers in the whole artificial intelligence community have also 
			    realized the importance of Explainable AI, which aims to address a wide range of AI explainability 
			    problems in deep learning, computer vision, automatic driving systems, and natural language processing 
			    tasks. Recent AI regulations such as EU GDPR and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 also encourage
			    the explainability and users' right to explanation of algorithmic decisions in 
			    AI systems. As an important branch of AI research, it highlights the importance our IR/RecSys community 
			    to address the explainability issues of various recommendation and search systems.

                    <p class="lead">
                        <strong>Abstract</strong>: Knowledge graphs have been used to support a wide range of applications and enhance search and QA for Google, Amazon Alexa, etc. However, we often miss long-tail knowledge, including unpopular entities, unpopular relations, and unpopular verticals. In this talk we describe our efforts in harvesting knowledge from semi-structured websites, which are often populated according to some templates using vast volume of data stored in underlying databases. We describe our AutoCeres ClosedIE system, which improves the accuracy of fully automatic knowledge extraction from 60%+ of state-of-the-art to 90%+ on semi-structured data. We also describe OpenCeres, the first ever OpenIE system on semi-structured data, that is able to identify new relations not readily included in existing ontologies. In addition, we describe our other efforts in ontology alignment, entity linkage, graph mining, and QA, that allow us to best leverage the knowledge we extract for search and QA.

                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <strong>Abstract</strong>: Explainable recommendation and search is a very promising topic in both academia and industry in the recent years. There are many human generated recommendation reasons for products in Alibaba Taobao to improve user experience and to increase user stickiness. However, relying on human-generated content will result in low coverage, low quality stability, and high financial expenditure. With the rapid development of deep learning technology in NLP, especially in the nature language generation field, we tried natural language generation approach in recommendation reason generation and achieved good results. We created recommendation reasons for auction and auction list, which covered millions of product categories in Taobao e-commerce, and the generated explanations were used for large-scale real-world trasactions in "2017 Double 11 Shopping Festival" without any manual checking. Industry-level real system experiments show that it was very difficult to distinguish whether the explanations are machine-generated or manually-written, and the content generation can be controlled in multiple dimensions such as text style, text length, topics, etc. We will introduce our solution and technical details about generating free-text explanations in this keynote.

He is responsible for the intelligent recommendation reason generation project, which won the biggest Alibaba technical award in "2017 Double 11 Online Shopping Festival". He is now responsible for the overall international search algorithm team in Alibaba.
