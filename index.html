                        Recent years have witnessed the success of machine learning and especially deep learning in many research areas such as IR, Data Mining, Vision and Natural Language Processing. Though various learning approaches have demonstrated satisfying performance in perceptual tasks such as pattern recognition and matching by extracting useful features from data, the area still sees a large amount of research needed to advance from perceptual learning to cognitive reasoning in the coming years towards cognitive intelligence. This includes but is not limited to neural logic reasoning, probabilistic logic reasoning, neural-symbolic reasoning, causal reasoning, knowledge reasoning and commonsense reasoning.

                        <strong>Abstract</strong>: In this talk I will argue for an unpopular idea on acquiring symbolic knowledge and integrate it into natural language understanding systems for global reasoning. I will use Information Extraction (IE) as a case study and present three different ways to integrate symbolic knowledge with distributional embedding representation: (1) transform input data by adding symbolic knowledge annotations, and use the transformed data for embedding learning; (2) convert input unstructured text into semantic graphs using semantic parsing, and then use Graph Neural Networks to initialize representation with embedding, and use the constructed semantic graphs to propagate representations; (3) use symbolic representations as global constraints in information decoding; (4) discover new types of information with embedding and name the clusters with symbolic knowledge. I will show the impact of these solutions on various IE tasks including complex event schema induction, schema-guided IE for various domains, event coreference resolution and temporal event reasoning.

                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <strong>Abstract</strong>: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, especially with the advancement of pre-training techniques. However, for tasks that require more complex reasoning beyond text pattern matching, including numerical calculation and logic reasoning, language models themselves are insufficient. Furthermore, deep neural networks have exposed limitations in compositional generalization, the capability to learn compositional rules and apply them to unseen cases in a systematic manner, which is critical for language understanding. In this talk, I will discuss my work on neural-symbolic reasoning, where we address the abovementioned challenges by integrating symbolic modules into deep neural networks. First, I will discuss my work on neural-symbolic reader for reading comprehension. By equipping a pre-trained language model with a symbolic reasoning module that synthesizes and executes programs according to the natural language text, our Neural-symbolic Reader surpasses the state-of-the-art on DROP and MathQA, which are recent benchmarks that require challenging numerical reasoning, while also provides better interpretability. Afterward, I will discuss my work on Neural-Symbolic Stack Machines (NeSS) towards achieving compositional generalization. NeSS combines the expressive power of neural sequence models with the capability of symbolic execution supported by the stack machine, and achieves full generalization on multiple domains that require compositional language understanding.
